Glasp is a social web highlighter and annotation tool designed to help you stay organized and manage your time effectively, whether you're a professional working on a project, a student studying for an exam, or anyone just trying to be more productive in your day-to-day life. Glasp lets you collect what truly matters to you from the web, and express yourself through your collection of highlights and notes, while also leaving a meaningful and valuable legacy for other like-minded individuals to benefit from.

In this guide, we will take a closer look at the Glasp app and explore its features in-depth, and provide you with a comprehensive understanding of how to use the Glasp app effectively. By the end of this guide, you’ll have a better understanding of how to streamline your workflow, boost your productivity, and manage your time effectively with Glasp.

## What is Glasp? 
![](images/what-is-glasp.jpg)

Glasp stands for "Greatest Legacy Accumulated as Share Proof" and it is a social web highlighter and annotation tool that allows users quickly capture online content with colored highlighting options, take and organize notes and thoughts from the web, and also discover useful content from other like-minded people.

It is a Chrome extension designed to boost productivity and streamline workflow. One advantage of Glasp is that it helps you highlight and add notes as you read. With Glasp, users can avoid the back-and-forth between the web and a note-taking app.

Glasp also beautifully organizes your collection of highlights, so you can easily return to what truly matters to you anytime. These highlights can then be tagged, searched for, linked to, and shared on a variety of other platforms, including Twitter, Trello, and Slack with one click. Glasp also supports integration with these platforms.

Glasp integration with these platforms is an added advantage as it allows users to access all their productivity tools in one place. As a result, users can manage their tasks and projects more efficiently, without having to switch back and forth between different apps.

By following like-minded people on Glasp, you get to discover and collect useful content that expands your knowledge and thoughts, and with one click, the content you’ve collected appears across all your devices. This way Glasp addresses the problem of isolation of knowledge as others can interact with your highlights and vice versa.

Just like the co-founder of Glasp Kazuki Nakayashi said “If you leave your knowledge, insights, and experiences only in personal spaces (e.g. note-taking apps), no one can access them after you die. You might be able to publish your notes just before you die but no one knows when it is. Since collective learning is how humans got smarter across generations, it would be a huge loss for all if we can't access what you have learned throughout our life”.

## Why use Glasp?

With so many productivity apps out there, you may be wondering why you should choose Glasp. In this section, we'll explore the key benefits of using Glasp and why it stands out from other similar apps. Here are some of the ways Glasp stands out from other productivity tools out there.

- **Allows for collaborative knowledge sharing:** Glasp is a social web highlighter and annotation tool, which means it allows users to share their highlights and annotations with others, making it a collaborative tool that fosters knowledge sharing and discovery. This feature sets Glasp apart from other productivity apps that are more focused on individual use.
- **Efficient time management:** Glasp is designed to help users manage their time effectively by providing them with an easy-to-use tool for collecting and organizing information from the web.

- **Versatility at its best:** Glasp offers advanced features such as the ability to search for highlights and annotations, filter them by tags, and export them to other apps.
